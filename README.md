## Vector AES Instructions for Security Applications

This is the supporting code repository for the paper "VASA: Vector AES Instructions for Security Applications" to appear and be presented at [ACSAC'21](https://www.acsac.org/) by Jean-Pierre MÃ¼nch, Hossein Yalame, and Thomas Schneider.

The intention behind this code and repository is primarily to show how to use VAES and give concrete examples of how we used it, so you can adapt it to your library / framework / application.

The above promised code will be online before the paper is presented in early december.
